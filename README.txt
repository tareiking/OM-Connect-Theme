OM Connect WordPress Theme
====================================================

OM-Connect was built for the Ourmarae.com platform, which helps get New Zealand marae sites online with the power of WordPress as the web publishing platform.

The Ourmarae.com platform requires themes to be easy to customise, offer a limited range of extensibility and be compatible with some common plugins. As Ourmarae.com is a platform built for open-sourcing, it was decided to offer this theme to the WordPress community.

Permission for the creation of the theme based on the design from Connect Theme by Organic Themes has been expressly granted as per ticket https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20488
